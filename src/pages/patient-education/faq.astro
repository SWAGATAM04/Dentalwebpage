      {
        q: "How often should I visit the dentist?",
        a: "We recommend visiting the dentist every six months for routine checkups and professional cleanings. However, some patients may need more frequent visits based on their oral health needs."
      },
      {
        q: "What's the best way to brush my teeth?",
        a: "Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste. Brush at a 45-degree angle to your gums, using gentle circular motions. Brush all surfaces of your teeth for at least two minutes, twice daily."
      },
      {
        q: "Why is flossing important?",
        a: "Flossing removes plaque and food particles between teeth where your toothbrush can't reach. Daily flossing helps prevent cavities, gum disease, and bad breath."

    category: "Dental Procedures",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "Does getting a filling hurt?",
        a: "No, you shouldn't feel pain during a filling. We use local anesthesia to numb the area completely. You might feel slight pressure or vibration, but no pain."
      },
      {
        q: "How long do dental implants last?",
        a: "With proper care and maintenance, dental implants can last a lifetime. The crown attached to the implant typically needs replacement every 10-15 years due to normal wear."
      },
      {
        q: "Is teeth whitening safe?",
        a: "Yes, professional teeth whitening is safe when performed under dental supervision. We use approved whitening agents and take precautions to protect your gums and sensitive teeth."

      },
      {
        q: "What forms of payment do you accept?",

    category: "Children's Dental Care",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "When should my child first visit the dentist?",
        a: "The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommends scheduling your child's first dental visit by their first birthday or when their first tooth appears."
      },
